**Arduino Oplà IoT Kit**  Kit allows you to build your next smart project. Ever wanted an automated house? Or a smart garden? Well, now it’s easy with the Arduino IoT Cloud compatible boards. It means: you can connect devices, visualize data, control and share your projects from anywhere in the world.

Generally, to build any IoT project prototype, What will be the important components?. So, typically, We must require a microcontroller board with connectivity to internet. This MCU board supposed to be a brain of the project. Which should be enabled with either connectivity option, like ethernet or WiFi, or both.

Then, we will also require some sensors, To get the input data from surrounding environment. like, temperature, Humidity, light, proximity, Moisture, Gas, Et Cetra.  We also need some output devices, actuators, or, control elements. To control the equipments or devices. like, Relays, Motors, Lights, Buzzer, Et cetra. We also need some display devices, to see what is happening around. And finally, we also expect this project should be constantly powered, stand alone, as uninterrupted service.

What if all these requirements of typical IoT project comprises in one device? Then, it will become very easy to build such a project and also very useful to understand the basic concepts of Internet of Things, Fast prototyping, and testing the proof of concepts. Opla IoT Kit makes this possible. Because This kit consist of, Arduino Maker IoT Carrier, plus, Arduino MAKER WiFi 10 10 development board. The Carrier board consists of 
- OLED Display. 
- Five capacitive touch buttons. 
- Five RGB LED's. 
- On-board sensors - Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Pressure Sensor, Light Sensor, IMU sensor, Gesture Sensor, RGB color Sensor. 
- Also facility to connect Proximity sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor
- Then, carrier board also have two analog compatible groove connectors and One I2C compatible groove connector. 
- Two 24 Volts relays. 
- Micro SD card holder. 
- Buzzer and, 
- Li-Ion rechargeable battery holder with charging circuitry. 
  
The Oplà IoT Kit allows you to add connectivity to devices around the home or workplace. It comes complete with a set of 8 Internet of Things self assemble projects ready to show you how to turn everyday appliances into ‘smart appliances’ and build custom connected devices that can be controlled with your mobile phone.

    Remote Controlled Lights - change color, light modes and switch on/off via your mobile
    Personal Weather Station - record and monitor local weather conditions
    Home Security Alarm - Detect motions and trigger warnings
    Solar System Tracker - retrieve data from planets and moons in the Solar System
    Inventory Control - track goods in & out
    Smart Garden - monitor and control the environment for your plants
    Thermostat Control - smart control for heating and cooling systems
    Thinking About You - send messages between the Oplà and the Arduino IoT Cloud
